PrestoClient for R
==================

Install
-------

This package can be installed in R using these commands:

	# Uncomment next line if you don't have devtools installed yet
	#install.packages("devtools")
	library(devtools)
	install_github("easydatawarehousing/prestoclient/RPresto")


RPresto uses packages: RCurl and jsonlite. On Linux/Debian systems it may
be necessary to install libCurl, including development files. On Ubuntu
this should work:

	sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev
