VERSION INFORMATION: PrestoClient
=================================

Version 0.3.0 BETA - Jan 30, 2014
---------------------------------
- Added the C version. This includes a sample application but is meant to be
  the basis for other software in need of a way to communicate with a Presto
  server. Note that the license for the C version is GPLv3 to be in line with
  other software that I intend to use this with.
- Update to Python version: Made it a bit quicker by lowering the time
  between requests to the Presto server when data is being recieved.
  Added the runquery function.
